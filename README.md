# gdash

GMetri's Lodash - mostly isomorphic (Can be used on both Client and Server side)

To run locally:

```
./sd
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## Notes 

* Need to manually publish a scoped package with `npm publish --access public` to tell npmjs that this is a public scoped package (as opposed to private scoped package by default)
